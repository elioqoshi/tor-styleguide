# Tor Project Style Guide
The Visual Style Guide of the Tor Project created in collaboration with Simply Secure.

----

The visual identity of software is an integral part of its user experience. Correctly using a consistent and attractive style is important to The Tor Project because it helps users build trust in the work we do.

We hope that this guide will help you create materials and answer 
potential questions you might have about the use of the Tor brand.

That said, there is a reason we call this a style guide and not a set of style rules. There may be situations that this guide does not cover, and where you find yourself needing to stretch the standards a bit. Please reach out to us and tell us about these cases, so that we can both review your solution and work to improve the guide over time.

For any questions and inquiries you might have related to this styleguide, we encourage you to reach out to our in-house UX team who will be able to facilitate your needs:
